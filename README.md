# TypeScript Workshop

Code for the small workshop I gave on TypeScript. The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OzWHc6De7pj1XYITd2ctsob4-a5JBcPQYcOn6e87dcQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [recording](https://youtu.be/9vlaRm4JuLs) are available.

## What's next?

These two pages on the official TypeScript website introduce even more content in detail:
* [Advanced Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) - An overview of the more advanced features of TypeScript
* [Update 2.8](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html) - The update that introduced conditional types. Has some pretty cool types introduced!
